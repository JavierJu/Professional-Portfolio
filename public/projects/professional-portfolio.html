      <h2 class="projects-body__heading">About</h2>
      <p>My portfolio fundamentally revolves around my other projects. Focused on showcasing a select few with
        high-quality standards. The core of the application was built from December 2020 - January 2021, with sporadic
        updates up until January 2023.</p>

      <ul class="projects-body__list">
        <li>Custom loading page animation for home page and project pages. Animation is supposed to simulate a developer
          writing code in an Integrated Development Environment on a MacBook Pro. Art style is a cross between graphic
          design and illustration to abstract away unnecessary details.</li>
        <li>For projects that leveraged AdobeXD for wireframing or prototyping, embedded an interactive AdobeXD on the
          webpage. Furthermore, positioned the iframe over a hyper-realistic SVG image of an iPhone and MacBook Pro to
          further simulate the experience of interacting with the content in its native device.</li>
        <li>For full-stack projects, created diagrams of code architecture, database schema, and production system
          architecture with <a href="https://www.draw.io/" class="curriculum__link" target="_blank"

    <!-- UX/UI MOCKS AND GRAPHIC DESIGN -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="projects-body__heading">UX/UI Mocks and Graphic Design</h2>
      <p class="projects-body__paragraph-spacing-below">Used open-souce SVG assets from <a
          href="https://simpleicons.org/" class="curriculum__link" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">simpleicons</a> and from <a href="https://icomoon.io/app/#/select"
          class="curriculum__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">icomoon</a> and placed them all in a
        <code>sprite.svg</code> file from the <code>symbol-defs.svg</code> file.
      </p>

      <p>Admittedly, I initially mocked this website in a physical notebook. Looking back, given how simple the initial
        design was, I think this is still appropriate, especially considering that I didn't have to share the mock with
        any teammates. At this point, it's quaint and nostalgic to think of mocking a website on the proverbial backside
        of a napkin.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="projects-body__heading">Design and Architecture</h2>
      <h3>Code Architecture</h3>
      <p class="projects-body__paragraph-spacing-below">Initially built this website with a backend server using <a
          href="https://expressjs.com/" class="curriculum__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ExpressJS</a>
        as the Node.js application framework, which was primarily used for serving the single page and for setting HTTP
        headers and Content Security Policy. I chose ExpressJS as the Node.js application framework for its simple,
        lightweight functionality. Furthermore I chose to use it to gain more practice because some companies still use
        it. When this application had a backend, I had to host it somewhere, so I chose to host it on <a
          href="https://www.heroku.com/" class="curriculum__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroku</a>
        due to the simplicity of Heroku as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution. At one point, the website was hosted
        on the Hobby (paid) plan on Heroku to guarantee site reliability uptime. The main problem with this overall
        approach was that it was both heavy and expensive. It was heavy in that ExpressJS wasn't strictly neccessary
        just to serve a single page. It was expensive in that the Hobby plan was $7 per month. Therefore, after learning
        about the <a href="https://jamstack.org/" class="curriculum__link" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamstack</a>, I refactored this application by migrating from a server-based
        architecture with ExpressJS to a static website architecture with simple HTML. I switched cloud-hosting
        providers from Heroku to Netlify. The code is more simple and efficient, the website has better performance, and
        the cloud-hosting provider is free.</p>

      <p class="projects-body__paragraph-spacing-below">Initially utilized a one-page layout to force creativity in
        front-end capabilities. In particular, the information in the project pages used to be available only through a
        modal popup. This certainly forced some implementation creativity for the front-end. However, when I had ideas
        for making the project pages more content-rich and even interactive, the little modal window started to prove to
        be a bottleneck. Furthermore, the Google web crawler was not able to index the crucial information in the modal
        because in the implementation, I had to set the <code>display</code> to <code>none</code> in order to hide it
        until a user clicked on a button to show it.</p>

      <p class="projects-body__paragraph-spacing-below">Instead of using a CSS framework like Boostrap, I created all
        the CSS features from scratch for greater control and customization. I chose to use Sass as the CSS superscript
        for a few reasons. One was to facilitate using BEM notation. More importantly though, using Sass has a few more
        useful features than plain CSS, such as the ability to use a <code>@mixin</code>. I also chose Sass because at
        the time I was unaware of native CSS variables. Regarding the display, I employed a combination of CSS float,
        flex, and grid properties to gain practice with using each of these approaches. I ensured that the entire
        website was responsive and used a desktop-first construction methodology. Looking back, I would use a
        mobile-first construction methodology instead to slightly decrease load time. Optimized responsive design for 8
        screen sizes largely following the Google Chrome default screen size breakpoints (4K, LaptopL, Laptop, Tablet,
        Mobile L, Mobile M, Mobile S). At the time I wasn't aware of other options for choosing screen size breakpoints,
        so I just went with what Google Chrome provides in the Developer Tools. Implemented responsive design with
        <code>media queries</code>.
      </p>

      <p class="projects-body__paragraph-spacing-below">Increased Google Lighthouse performance score from 12 to 88 and
        decreased DOM Content Loaded time from 10s to 2s using intersection observer and lazy loading for images and
        video. Then decreased first visit DOM Content Loaded time from 7s to 1s by refactoring the website from using an
        express.js server to a static site with no web server.</p>

      <h3>Production System Architecture</h3>
      <p class="projects-body__paragraph-spacing-below">There are currently two separate code repositories, deployment
        pipelines, and web domains. One for this website, my portfolio, and another for my <a
          href="https://www.jacobgrisham.dev/">blog</a>. Both repos use different technology stacks that weren't
        integrating well with one another, so I isolated my blog and just linked them together with <code>a</code> tags.
        When I initially created this portfolio, it was at the start of my software engineering journey, indeed I built
        the core of this website approximately 2 months into learning web development for the first time. So I built
        this website with raw HTML and only used Sass as an abstraction on top of CSS. When I created my blog, I was 3
        years into my software engineering journey, so I had the benefit of experience to choose a tech stack like
        Gatsby with React for the blog. Integrating Gatsby, particularly <a
          href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/" class="curriculum__link"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this specific blog template</a>, with raw HTML was a good challenge,
        however after a certain point, I felt I was straying away from the core problem, <em>starting</em> a blog in the
        first place. Therefore, I decided to keep both the code and production system architectures separate. I have
        plans of building out a new, better portfolio website with React in the future, at which point I'l be able to
        integrate my portfolio and blog under one codebase, one deployment pipeline, and ultimately one domain. But for
        now, this overall strategy helps to remove the friction with starting a blog.</p>
